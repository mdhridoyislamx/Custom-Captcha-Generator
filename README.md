# Custom Captcha Generator

A simple Custom Captcha Generator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project aims to create a customizable CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) generator using front-end technologies. CAPTCHA is used to determine whether the user is a human or a bot by presenting challenges that are easy for humans to solve but difficult for machines.

The custom CAPTCHA generator in this project allows users to generate unique challenges with different configurations, such as varying fonts, colors, distortions, and more.

## Features

- **Random Challenge Generation:** Generates unique challenges using random characters and styles.
- **Customizable Settings:** Allows users to tweak the font style, color, distortion, and complexity of the CAPTCHA.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the CAPTCHA display adapts to different screen sizes.
